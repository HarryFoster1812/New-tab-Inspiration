# New-tab-Inspiration

## Are you tired of opening a new tab and seeing an *insparational message*?

*So am I*, that's why i created this chrome extension! Bring yourself back down to ***reality*** every time you open a new tab!

## Installation

To install this chrome extension go to the browser and type: **chrome://extensions/**, After I think you need to have developer settings enabled. The last step is to either click load unpacked extension and select the folder or drag and drop the file with the extension of **crx**
